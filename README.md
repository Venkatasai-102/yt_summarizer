# YOUTUBE VIDEO SUMMARIZER
Fed up with watching a long video only to realize its waste of time... üò¢, now those days are gone ü§©. Get a quick summary of any video* and decide whether to watch or not. Let me introduce the youtube video summarizer which takes a youtube video and gives you the summary, insights and guess what, it provides the summary and thoughts from top comments as well ü§úü§õ. And.. it just takes a few clicks and seconds. Here is what it does in detail:
- Takes a youtube URL and gets the transcript if available, otherwise, no summary from transcript is given but the comments is part is still present (if comments itself are present üòú).
- Analyzes the text, understands it and creates a comprehensive and detailed summary.
- Give a brief summary and divides the entire transcript in to meaningful sections and explain them.
- At the end, it provides, key insights and mentions some quotations used in the video.
- It takes top `100` comments, anazlyses and says what most people are saying, lists any insightful/thoughtful comments

`*` -> Currently supported languages: Telugu, Hindi and English
## How to setup
- Create a python virtual environment and install the following pip modules:
```bash
